### About the Project<a name="description"/>
<section>
Pixel Walker is a virtual actor in a virtual environment that is trained to recognize, classify, and act upon commands given by the application user. The user will input a sentence string into our program, upon which it will be parsed by GPT-3, a natural language processor. This result will then be fed into Unity3D wherein the virtual actor, which has been trained several select actions using ML-agents, will perform actions implied by the user’s input string in a three-dimensional virtual world space, simulating a home garage environment.

# Key Terms to Note: <br>

·    Unity3D – A game engine in which we will create and simulate our virtual environment and agents.

·    ML-agents - A tool in unity that uses reinforcement learning to train virtual agents to perform actions.

·    GPT-3 – A neural network machine uses machine learning to create human like texts.

There will be a tech demo in order to further our own understanding of reinforcement learning, and to observe which training strategies and learning algorithms are most effective in this problem space. Unity3D provides two different reinforcement learning algorithms. For example, Unity offers both a Proximal Policy Optimization (an on-policy strategy) and Soft Actor Critic (an off-policy) learning methods. It will be beneficial for our group to learn more about these two algorithm classes and how they respond to our use case.

Many robots that complete tasks only follow motion data copied from a person performing actions. We want to test more dynamic responses in a non-static environment, training the agent to teach itself to solve problems instead of having us supply the solution data for them. This idea could be a small contribution towards AI gaining the autonomy to solve problems on its own. We hope this will sparks curiosity from young developers interested in reinforcement learning.
